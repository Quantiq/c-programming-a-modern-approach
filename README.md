# C Programming: A Modern Approach - Solutions
Solutions to exercises and projects in the textbook C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition.

This is a patched fork, since the original hasn't been maintained since 2015. I've fixed some incorrect solutions, restyled quite a few answers to be more inline with some of the book's formatting choices, and made some answers easier to read and understand.

Note that these are not the instructor resources for the book, these are just modifications I've made for the purpose of self-study that you can use at your own discretion. Instructors can obtain textbook solutions and resources by [emailing the author](http://knking.com/books/c2/resources.html). Some solutions can be found on the author's [website](http://knking.com/books/c2/answers/index.html).

If you see anything that I may have missed, or noticed anything that's incorrect feel free to send a pull request.
